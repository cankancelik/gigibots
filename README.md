# Gigibots Project (In Progress)
The project is a playground for robotics enthusiasts. The aim of the project is to enable learning image processing, path planning, search, SLAM using no real life sensors.

# HOW?
At the top of the playground there is a camera to keep track the instantaneous pose of the robots and obstacles. Then from the pose info a digital twin created (link here) in the WEBOTS enviroment and sensors attached to each robot and sensor data info shared to the user hence user can work with the data and apply any kind of algorithms that is desired.

# Nodes to be Manipulated
Game node and user node can be altered. Game node is the where the tasks, rules and sensor pecifications determined by the game master. User node is the node where users can obtain sensor and other required info published by the game master in order to implement their algorithm.

# Shared Datas
Lidar Data
Camera attached on Robot
Cut Map 
(for easier image processing user may be provided bird eye view map from its position to the limits of the map with slice of determined ifeld of view)
Player ID & TYPE
